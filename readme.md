<h4 style="color: #922224" align="center">Serratec OOP Final Project</h4>
<p align="center">This project was the final project for the OOP discipline in the FullStack course from Serratec. Our team worked together to create a complete CRUD application with all database processes, including configuring PostgreSQL, using JDBC, and connecting with the database.</p>

<p align="center">The program simulates a sales software where you can create, update, and delete orders. The product stock is updated after creating, updating, or removing an order, based on the ordered products. Although it is a console program, it has a user-friendly interface.</p>
